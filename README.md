<title>**Diabetes Prediction Model - Azure ML Studio**</title>title <br>

<b><u>Summary</U></b> <br>
This project uses Azure Machine Learning Studio to develop a complete machine learning solution for diabetes prediction.
The approach, which is implemented as a flexible cloud service for real-time inference, uses clinical data to predict diabetes 
risk with high accuracy.

<b><u>Business Value</u></u>
- Early Detection: Finds people who are at risk before they exhibit clinical symptoms.
